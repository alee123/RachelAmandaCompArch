Note: After sending this to the Comp arch email I realize that we sent you guys a bad copy of the code. I've fixed what I could and uploaded it since the good copy is on another computer. Oh well. 


This is the code used for Rachel Mathew's and Amanda Lee's final Computer Architecture project. To see the documentation of our project go to http://wikis.olin.edu/ca/doku.php?id=2014:fpga_guitar_pedalboard
